## 🗂 File Structure

All code is kept in a single file per day for simplicity.

| Day | File Name  | Topics Covered                                   |
|-----|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | day01.cpp  | Hello World, Data Types, Variables               |
| 2   | day02.cpp  | Typecasting, If-else Statement, Basic For loop   |
| 3   | day03.cpp  | Advance For Loop(Prime Number, Fibonacci Series) |

(More days will be added as I progress 🚀)
